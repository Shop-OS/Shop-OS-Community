Hi there,

I'm Sai, working away in the kitchen at The House of Models. I wanted to personally reach out and say how excited we are to have you join our community!

We started this to put a ding in the commerce world. We’re rethinking what a store is through the power of AI, it's incredibly valuable for us to understand the perspectives and needs you have so that we make the platform exactly what you need. 

I wanted to send you a House of Models welcome pack, which includes a tshirt we love, and a cheatsheet on how to make AI work for you if you are a brand owner.

I'm curious - what's happening in your world that led you to sign up for House of Models? 

What challenges or opportunities are you seeing in eCommerce that you think AI could help address?

We believe we're on the cusp of a major shift in online shopping experiences, one driven by AI agents that can deliver hyper-personalized, engaging storefronts at scale. But to make that vision a reality, we need insights from people on the frontlines of eCommerce.

So whether you're a brand looking to boost conversions, a marketplace seller aiming to stand out, or simply a curious observer of the AI and eCommerce spaces - I'd love to hear your thoughts! What excites you about the potential of AI in eCommerce? What concerns or questions do you have?

Feel free to just reply to this email with any thoughts, no matter how brief or unstructured. I read every response personally. 

Also, I'm always eager to learn how folks discover us. 
How did you first hear about House of Models?

Thanks in advance for your time and insights. This AI is not for everyone. But it is for you. So your input is invaluable as we shape the House into the right sized rocket that brings in more $$$ to your store - and changes eCommerce as we know it.

The GPUs are on standby. 
Get started making your first big idea! 
Let’s go.

Cheers,
Sai
